# FakeRaffle
A simple app to let you rig a raffle by supplying a winning number before spinning. 

Type the number you want to win first and then press "Set." The box will disappear and then you can set your max number and pretend to draw a number like you would normally. 

Meant mainly as a proof of concept to show the issues with online raffles and how easily they can be rigged.
